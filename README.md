### Links

- Live Site URL: [Preview](https://github.com/K0smic/nft-preview-card-component)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned
This project took longer than expected, there are many variables to take into account such as the revision of the grid documentation, the non-use of Bootstrap, the Javascript code and the measures to be as faithful as possible to the design.

All in all I am very satisfied with the result, I would like to seek as many tips as possible to make the code more optimized and more readable.

### Useful resources

- [Font-size Clamp Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app/) - Perfect for resizing any size, from fonts to images.
- A ruler - I measured the distances and everything with a ruler, I used the responsive mode of chrome both on my project and on the images.
